    "The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also known as the NHTSA is a US national agency that aims to increase motor vehicle and highway safety. One of the ways this is accomplished is by providing a crash statistics database up until 2020. According to the database, the number of registered motor vehicles have consistently risen since 1994. The number of fatalities do not follow this trend. The fatality rate generally decreased from 23.21 per 100,000 licensed drivers in 1994 to 15.29 in 2014 but after 2014 this trend changed and the fatality rates started going back up and in 2020 the rate is at 17.01 per 100,000 licensed drivers. This has been attributed to various factors related to driver error [1].  This indicates that there is an increased need of improving motor vehicle safety. Autonomous Vehicles would help with this by reducing distracted driving, driving while under alcohol influence, etc."

    "The DARPA Grand Challenge of 2007 saw one team present an autonomous off-road vehicle [2]. In this paper they first explain how the DARPA Grand challenges also provide a source of impetus for development and integration of research as well as to focus public attention and increase acceptance of these technologies. Lastly, they explain how their vehicle GC'05 showcases their platform and strategies. Such papers are critical in not only introducing the field to new researchers but also provide a way for experienced researchers to integrate the presented research. This collaborative effort is an excellent way to advance the autonomous vehicles field due to interdisciplinary nature of the research involved."
